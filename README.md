## [Project 1: Air_Pollution_Data_Exploration - Dimentionality Reduction - PCA and t-SNE](https://github.com/Adedeji44/Air_Pollution_Data_Exploration)

Air pollution is all around us, indoors, outdoors, in cities, and in the countryside. The rise in permissible concentrations of various pollutants observed over the last few decades contributes to rising pollution levels. As a result, affecting the weather conditions in an unfavorable manner and the formation of smog phenomena. In fact, the affected air quality level in the atmosphere has a negative impact on individual health and may cause an economic imbalance. Diseases caused by rising pollution levels are one of the major issues confronting urban settlements

**Objective :** 

**- Explore and visualize the Air Pollution dataset, which contains information about air molecules and pollutants found in the air**

**- Reduce the number of features by using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE, and extract insights about the data.**

## [Project 2: Socio_Economic_Factors_for_Geographic_Clustering](https://github.com/Adedeji44/Socio_Economic_Factors_for_Geographic_Clustering)
### K Means, K Mediods, Gaussian Mixture Model, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN

The study of socio-economic factors is foundational to understanding and shaping the future of societies and hence of extreme interest to various government and non-government institutions. While GDP is one of the important measures used in one of the popular economic vernacular, it is not the only measure of the growth and the state of an economy. This project aims to deep dive into one such dataset that contains various socio-economic attributes for countries around the world.

**Objective : Identify if there exist various clusters of countries that are more similar to each other than others, in terms of certain socio-economic factors.**

## [Project 3: CAVIAR_Network_Analysis - Generating Networks Graphs and Analysing using Centrality Measures](https://github.com/Adedeji44/CAVIAR_Network_Analysis).
## Eigenvector, Betweenness, and Closeness Centrality measures

Project is based on information on the CAVIAR project and the role of certain individuals arrested following the investigation. The investigation lasted two years and ran from 1994 to 1996. The operation was brought together by investigation units of the Montreal police and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police of Canada. During these two years, 11 wiretap warrants, valid for about two months each, were obtained (11 matrices match these phases).

**Objective - We will analyze and understand a time-varying criminal network that was repeatedly disrupted by police forces, and how the criminal network reoriented in response to the seizures of product by the police forces.**
